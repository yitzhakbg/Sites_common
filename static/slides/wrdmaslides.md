Close proximity D2D mobile or wireless device _cluster-carpets_ are the next generation application platform. _Cluster-Carpet_ is a cluster woven so tightly that individual devices are indistinguishable to the application.

Distributed apps over on-the-fly clusters in the cloud are gaining popularity, but todays networking strata is sorely lacking for the job and remote clouds are unnecessary for close-proximity applications.

The widely used RDMA clustering model with verbs programming has been a standard in HPC data centers for decades. Becomes the ideal model for wireless carpets. Cluster-carpet applications are <u>_unaware_ of being distributed</u>.

## Metcalfe and Olson's mistake was binding the platform with what could be done with it. We never have an inkling. No one knew what could be done with personal computers, no one knew what could be done with the web, no one knew what could be done with smartphones. Let's not repeat that mistake.
